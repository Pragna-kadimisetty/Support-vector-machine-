 Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification – Breast Cancer Dataset
 
  Overview

This project applies Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset.
It covers both Linear and Non-Linear (RBF kernel) SVMs, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and visualization of decision boundaries.

All results (reports, confusion matrices, and plots) are automatically saved in the svm_outputs folder for easy reference.
